Description: Contain code to work with the `cgeneric` 
  latent Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) models. 
  The `cgeneric` is a way to implement new GMRF models 
  to be fitted as model components and can be accessed 
  from a C program like 'INLA' (<https://www.r-inla.org>).
  The `cgeneric` defines a C struct contaning code for 
  GMRF model specifications and its parameter priors.
  Queries such are implemented so one can access it from R.
  The implemented functionalities leverage the use 
  of 'cgeneric' models and provide a way to debug 
  the code as well to work with the prior for the 
  model parameters and to sample from it. 
  A Kronecker product method is also implemented to 
  work with the four possible combinations between 
  a 'cgeneric' and a 'rgeneric' model.
