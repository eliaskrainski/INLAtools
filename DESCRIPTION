Description: Contain code to work with a C struct, in short
  cgeneric, to define a Gaussian Markov random (GMRF) model.
  A cgeneric model contain code to specify the graph and
  the precision matrix as well initial and prior for its
  parameters, and can be accessed from a C program.
  It is the recommended way to implement new GMRF models 
  in 'INLA' (<https://www.r-inla.org>).
  The 'INLAtools' contan code to make queries to evaluate 
  each one of the model specifications from R.
  The implemented functionalities leverage the use 
  of 'cgeneric' models and provide a way to debug 
  the code as well to work with the prior for the 
  model parameters and to sample from it. 
  A Kronecker product method is also implemented to 
  work with the four possible combinations between 
  a 'cgeneric' and a 'rgeneric' models.
